# 🧠 Snapzel – AI-Powered Company Brochure & Landing Page Generator

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Status:** Experimental, CLI-based prototype (Web version coming soon 🚀)

---

## ✨ What is Snapzel?

Snapzel is a developer-focused AI-powered tool that:

- Scrapes content from any public website 🌐
- Analyzes it using GPT to generate a **human-readable brochure** 📄
- Converts that brochure into **clean Markdown**
- Transforms the Markdown into a fully styled **HTML landing page** 🖥
- Saves everything locally for viewing or reuse

It's like a one-click assistant for building company overviews, marketing pages, or even startup decks — using nothing but a URL.

## 📦 Current Features

- ✅ Intelligent web scraper (using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`)
- ✅ Markdown brochure generator via GPT (OpenAI API)
- ✅ Styled HTML landing page generator (via AI)
- ✅ Local file output: `brochure.md` and `landing.html`
- ✅ Clean, modular Python architecture
- ✅ Session-based file separation using UUIDs

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. You provide a website URL.
2. Snapzel scrapes it, analyzes relevant content, and generates a brochure.
3. It then builds a full HTML landing page based on the brochure.
4. All files are saved under `temp/<session_id>/`.
